# Online Retail Invoices Visualization and Analysis
In this project I did some **visualization** and **analysis** from an online retail transaction data. 


The data that I used is a dataset from **UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository** called **Online-retail**.  
This dataset can be accessed --> [**here**](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail)  
This work was done using **Jupyter Notebook**. Too see the full code --> [**click here**](https://github.com/geraldsimanullang/Online-Retail-Invoices-Visualization-Analysis/blob/main/Online%20Retail%20Invoices%20Analysis.ipynb)

Okay, let's start.
