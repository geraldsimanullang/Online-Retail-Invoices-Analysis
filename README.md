# Visualization and Analysis of an Online Retail Invoices Dataset
In this project I conducted **visualization** and **analysis** on an online retail transaction dataset. 

The data I used is sourced from **UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository** and is referred to as the "**Online-retail**" dataset.  
You can access this dataset here --> <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail" target="_blank">Data Source</a>  
The analysis was performed using **Jupyter Notebook**. To view the complete code, please click here --> <a href="https://github.com/geraldsimanullang/Online-Retail-Invoices-Visualization-Analysis/blob/main/Online%20Retail%20Invoices%20Analysis.ipynb" target="_blank">Complete Code</a>
